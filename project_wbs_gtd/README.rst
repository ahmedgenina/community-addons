WBS GTD method
=====================

WBS level *Getting Things Done* methodology
-------------------------------------------
When dealing with WBS and WBS elements, sub-projects (example class Worklist)
take the parent role of the tasks. Since the number of wbs elements increases a
lot if compared to the single element projects, this module is meant as a tool
for the portfolio managers to approach the project lists as to a simple
personal to-do list.

This module implements a simple personal to-do list based on WBS elements. It
adds an editable list of **WBS elements** simplified to the minimum required
fields in the project application.

**It is based on the community module project_gtd and can coexist with it, since**
**this one applies the GTD approach on the "project" WBS level instead of task.**

The to-do list is based on the **Getting Things Done** methodology. This
world-wide used methodology is used for personal time management improvement.

**Getting Things Done** (commonly abbreviated as **GTD**) is an action management
method created by David Allen, and described in a book of the same name.

**GTD** rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind
by recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of
remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually
performing those tasks.
